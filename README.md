# Predict-profits-using-linear-regression
In this project, I implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from cities. We would like to use this data to help us select which city to expand to next.  The DataSet contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss. The first column refers to the population size in 10,000s and the second column refers to the profit in $10,000s
